The Blue Band Event Signup Application is designed to faciliate and better organize student signup for upcoming events. It allows users to register themselves to the applicaiton, login, search for a specific event, sign up for said event, and remove themselves from said event. The application also has a special admin login which allows for those with said permissions to create and edit events.
Some directories included in the project are:
Controller - Processes web requests by interacting with the service layer to complete work that needs to be done
